# **HAND WRITTEN DIGIT PREDICTION**

*Objective :* The objective of this data science project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately recognizes handwritten digits using Python and Google Colab. This involves leveraging data science techniques to load, preprocess, and analyze the MNIST dataset, training a classification model, and evaluating its performance. The goal is to create a robust and efficient model capable of reliably distinguishing between digits from 0 to 9, demonstrating practical applications in digit recognition and furthering our understanding of data science methodologies.
